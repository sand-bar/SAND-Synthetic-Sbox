# BAT-Synthectic-Sbox
Analysis of SSb in BAT block ciphers

## Synthetic S-box
We show the full informations about this synthetic S-box regarding differential and linear properties, which can be found in **[Synthetic-Sbox.ipynb](https://github.com/bat-team/BAT-Synthetic-Sbox/blob/master/Synthetic-Sbox.ipynb)**.

## DDT and LAT tests of small variant of round function
We check the consistency of DDTs and LATs generated by two methods: synthetic S-box calculation and big S-box, which can be found in **[12bit\_variant\_test](https://github.com/bat-team/BAT-Synthetic-Sbox/blob/master/12bit_variant_test)**.
